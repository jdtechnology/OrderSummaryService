# OrderSummaryService
Simple implementation using Spark.
I use Maven for dependancy management.

## Running
Simply clone this repository, and call `./run.sh`
That should run the tests and start the app.

Then you can use the endpoint `http://localhost:4567/summary/` and put the reference after the final slash
i.e. `http://localhost:4567/summary/SUCCESS`

To just run the tests use `mvn test`
